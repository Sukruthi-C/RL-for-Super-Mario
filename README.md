# RL-for-Super-Mario
## Description
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to play the Super Mario Bros game using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The game environment is pre-processed by converting images to grayscale and stacking multiple frames to capture the trajectory and velocity of Mario and his enemies. This helps reduce the computational load and provides a temporal dimension to the state inputs for better learning.
